Infosys Interview - 30 minutes

1. How to handle performance in react app in your company?

2. Find and filter.

3. Get server-side props and then get initial props.

4. In parent component, I have multiple child components. I am trying to update one of the child components. It is re-rendering everything. 
So whatever the components we have under parent, also parent, everything is getting re-rendered. So what could be the reason for that? How you can fix that?

5. Like I have a component, okay, like, say, a checkbox, the initial value is false, okay? When I try to check the checkbox, okay, it shows me false. 
Ideally, I should get true. It shows me false. So what could be the reason how you can fix it?

6. So that's the value I have it in array. I want only the value 1. So remaining things will be skipped and the output will be 1. Only 1. With the help of... Number 1. 
So it will be like inside array, we will have 2 1s. Okay. So how you can do that? I think we can use like the key property.
